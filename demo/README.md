## Running with Docker

This is the easiest setup option, especially if you do not have the Angular CLI installed. This setup does, however, require [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) to proceed.

### Running the demo

Open a terminal and navigate to the `./demo` folder of this repository:

```
$ cd orgbook-api/demo
```

Start the demo with the following command:

```
$ ./run_demo up
```

Once the demo is ready, open up your browser to http://localhost:8080

### Stopping the demo

Stop the demo and tear down created containers with the following command:

```
$ ./run_demo down
```

## Running locally

To run the demo locally, you will need to have the [Angular CLI](https://cli.angular.io) installed.

Navigate to the Angular application in this repository:

```
$ cd orgbook-api/demo/angular/orgbook-api
```

Please see the documentation [here](./angular/orgbook-api/README.md) for instructions on running the application with the Angular CLI.
